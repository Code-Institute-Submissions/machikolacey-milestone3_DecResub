## My Cafe Memories

This is a social network site for users to share memories of their cafes.

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/machikolacey/image/upload/v1601223705/milestone3/MS3_emwjc6.png" style="width:100%;"/>

The goal for the user is to share their cafe memories with other like-minded people, who would like to explore and find an ideal cafe for themselves.
Also, they can look at their cafe memories, go back to their memories, and share memories of their cafes.
They can choose either private or public for each memory, so they don't have to be worried about showing all the images they want to store for themselves.

In the future, this will give me an opportunity to ask cafe owners to provide their information by themselves, and also coupon code available for their customers. And also the cafe owner will be able to give them a 'Thank you' coupon code for positive reviewers.


<ul>
<li>An unregistered user can browse this website to see everyone's cafe memories.</li>
<li>If they become an user, they will be able to add their cafe memories.</li>
<li>They can add their memories from "Add memory" page. </li>
<li>They can search the cafe names by auto complete. </li>
<li>They can add cafe name(auto-complete), description, photo link, rating(1 to 5), Date(datepicker).</li>
<li>If they are unable to find the cafe, they can add a cafe from "Add cafe" page.</li>
<li>On "Add cafe" page, they can add area name(auto-complete), cafe name, website, postal address, postcode, photo link, and youtube link(optional).
</li>
<li>They can also browse and edit/ delete cafes from "Manage cafes" page.</li>
</ul>

### Features Left to Implement
- I would like to categorise cafes
- I would like to add more user information and user role - so cafe owner has more privilage to add their cafe information and also coupon code
- I would like to add coupon provided by cafe owners. This will potentially we can provide a package for cafe owners to have their subscriptions, give them ability to add campaigns targeting cafe freaks. 
- I would like to add a facility to give users more coupon code, when they contribute to this website by adding more memories. Hopefully we can provide subscriptions packages for them so they can benefit from sharing their memories.

## Data Integration
I used MongoDB for this project as this is a non-relational, documentation database. It gives me more flexibility and ability to manipulate or change structure of the data when I update this website in the future.
Only user_id, cafe_id, and memory_id need to be related, and it doesn't require complicated relations.

In my database, I made 4 collections, which are areas, cafes, memories and users.

#users
| :---      | :---      | 
| _id       | objectId | 
| username  | string   | 
| password  | hashed password   | 
| photo     | string   | 

#areas
| :---      | :---      | 
| _id       | objectId | 
| name  | string   | 

#cafes
| :---      | :---      | 
| _id       | objectId | 
| cafe_name  | string   | 
| website  | string  | 
| address     | string   | 
| postcode     | string  | 
| area_name     | string  | 
| photo     | string   | 
| youtube     | string   | 


#cafes
| :---      | :---      | 
| _id       | objectId | 
| cafe_name  | string   | 
| website  | string  | 
| address     | string   | 
| postcode     | string  | 
| area_name     | string  | 
| photo     | string   | 
| youtube     | string   | 



## Defensive Features
<ol>
<li>A new user can not register with a username already taken by existing user. So it checks existing usernames, if there is, it displays a flash message to suggest a different username.</li>
<li>We want a new user to understand that this is a social network service specialising in cafes. I added a popup to explain it and added buttons to choose wheather they register, or not to register.</li>
<li>We didn't want duplicate entries for a single cafe with multiple names, so I added a javascript code to auto-suggest cafe names.</li>
<li>We didn't want duplicate entries for an area, so I added a javascript code to auto-suggest area names.</li>
<li>We display a photo of the user on "Everyone's cafe memories" page. If a user choose not to upload their photo, it will display a default photo to avoid empty <img /> tag to be displayed.</li>
</ol>
